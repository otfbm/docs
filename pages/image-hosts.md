# Image Hosts

It is important to know that neither OTFBM nor Avrae directly host any images. The OTFBM map plugin currently relies on images hosted on the internet that aren't rate limited. In the past you could just upload an image to Discord and use their CDN link, and that worked great. Those golden times are gone, and until we can provision a proper map background upload service, this is how you work with it.

## Working

* flickr.com
  When you go to the image, click to download, but then choose, 'view all image sizes'. From there select original or whichever size you want. Once that loads, open that image in a new tab and use it's link.
* photouploads.com
* pinterest.com
  Make sure it says __originals__ in the url, otherwise the image will be limited to 736 pixels.
* github.com
  Requires a free account. Create a repository (shorter names are better as it will be in the url), and upload your maps into it. To use one, right click (or long press on mobile) the image and 'open in new tab'. the raw.githubusercontent.com url will work.

## Working with a url shortener

__short.io__ and __bit.ly__ have been tested.
