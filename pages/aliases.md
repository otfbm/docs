# Avrae aliases and OTFBM

Discord users `@Croebh`, `@Nerds and Dragons`, and `@Amenadude` have embraced OTFBM and created some really awesome Avrae aliases that utilize the site.

## Avrae

Avrae is a Discord bot centered around D&D 5e. It also has a built in automation and scripting engine. For more information on the bot please visit their website: https://avrae.io

## Aliases and Server Aliases

Aliases are user-made scripts that run using Avrae.  Aliases can be added by any user to their own account or, with special permissions, to a Discord server.  When you use any alias, `!move` for example, Avrae will prioritize the user alias over the server alias.  Adding a server alias requires the user to either have Administrator permissions on the Discord server, or a role on the server called either "Server Aliaser" or "Dragonspeaker".

## Avrae Dashboard

The easiest way to find alias collections is via the [Avrae Dashboard](https://avrae.io/dashboard/characters), in the [Alias Workshop](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop?order=popular-1w&page=1) "explore" section. You can browse collections there, view the available aliases each collection provides, subscribe to each one for your Discord user and/or for any servers you are a member of. You'll need to login to the dashboard with your Discord account to subscribe to collections.

Once you've subscribed to some aliases you likely don't know how to use yet, return to the server you added the aliases for and type `!alias` to make sure they show up in your personal list, or `!servalias` to see what aliases the server is subscribed to.

For help in Discord with any alias added from the Workshop, use `!help <alias>` or `!help <alias> -here` to view the help in-channel instead of a PM.

`!init` is an Avrae Command, not a user-made Alias, so there's no need to add it.  All official commands are listed in `!help`

`!map !move !distance !tokenimport !go !view !se` can be found at [Map Utlities](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/5f6a4623f4c89c324d6a5cd3)
